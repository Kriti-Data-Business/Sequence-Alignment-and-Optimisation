# Sequence-Alignment-and-Optimisation
This project implements and analyzes three fundamental sequence alignment algorithms in bioinformatics: Needleman-Wunsch (global alignment), Smith-Waterman (local alignment), and Hirschberg's space-optimized algorithm. The work demonstrates comprehensive understanding of dynamic programming paradigms, complexity analysis.
